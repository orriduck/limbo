When a [[Vue]] component is rendered, the following sequence of functions and lifecycle hooks are called:

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - **`beforeCreate`**: Called immediately after the instance has been initialized, but before data observation and event/watcher setup.
   - **`data`**: The `data` function is called to set up reactive properties on the instance.
   - **`props`**: The properties received from the parent component are initialized.
   - **`methods`**: Methods are added to the Vue instance.
   - **`computed`**: Computed properties are initialized and their getters are called for the first time.
   - **`watch`**: Watchers are set up to observe changes to reactive data.

2. **Creation Phase**:
   - **`created`**: Called after the instance is created, data observation is complete, and methods, computed properties, and watchers are set up. This is the earliest point at which you can access reactive data and watchers.

3. **Mounting Phase**:
   - **`beforeMount`**: Called right before the mounting begins: the `render` function is called for the first time.
   - **Render**: The component renders for the first time.
   - **`mounted`**: Called after the component has been mounted, where `el` is replaced by the newly created `vm.$el`.

4. **Updating Phase**:
   - **`beforeUpdate`**: Called when data changes, right before the DOM is patched.
   - **Render**: The component re-renders and patches the DOM.
   - **`updated`**: Called after the component has updated and the DOM is re-rendered.

5. **Destruction Phase**:
   - **`beforeDestroy`**: Called right before the component is destroyed.
   - **`destroyed`**: Called after the component is destroyed.

Here is a visual representation of the lifecycle hooks:

```plaintext
Initialization Phase:
- beforeCreate
- data
- props
- methods
- computed
- watch

Creation Phase:
- created

Mounting Phase:
- beforeMount
- Render (not a hook, but part of the process)
- mounted

Updating Phase:
- beforeUpdate
- Render (not a hook, but part of the process)
- updated

Destruction Phase:
- beforeDestroy
- destroyed
```

During the creation phase, `data`, `props`, `methods`, `computed`, and `watch` are initialized in that order. After the instance is created, `created` is called. Once the component is about to be added to the DOM, `beforeMount` is called, followed by the initial render, and then `mounted` is called. During updates, `beforeUpdate` and `updated` are called before and after the re-render, respectively. Finally, when the component is being removed, `beforeDestroy` and `destroyed` are called.
